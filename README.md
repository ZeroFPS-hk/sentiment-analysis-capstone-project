# sentiment-analysis-capstone-project
 
The capstone project I did for Hyperion Data Science Bootcamp. It is a python file that uses pandas module to read a database and extract its comments, then uses spacy module to peform natural language processing and sentiment analysis on the comments. It picks random comments to analyze and gives a clear readable output about the analysis result.

The database used in the program is "Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products_May19.csv" from Datafiniti: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products

The file is too large to upload to GitHub, please download the database with the link above and unzip in this repos folder to run this program correctly.
